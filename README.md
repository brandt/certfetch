# certfetch

A simple CLI program to fetch an entire certificate chain in PEM format.


## About

I whipped this up because I could never remember all the OpenSSL CLI args to pull down a certificate.

    echo | openssl s_client -verify 8 -showcerts -connect github.com:443

Even if you do remember all that, the version of `openssl` that ships with Mac OS X is so ancient that it would filp out on sites that only supported TLS 1.2.

The tool also prints out some common info about the certs to STDERR so that you don't have to run `openssl x509 -text` on every single certificate.

The last line of output indicates whether the chain passed verification.  If there was a problem verifying the chain, it will  have exit code 4.


## Usage

Usually, all you need to do is this:

    certfetch github.com

Additional options:

    -domain STRING      specify different domain used during TLS handshake
    -cafile STRING      path to a CA file (PEM) to verify with instead of the default system root certs
    -exp DURATION       warn if certificate will expire in this period of time (default 720h0m0s)
    -file STRING        read domain+addr pairs from this CSV file

The certificates are output to STDOUT.  Info about the certs is output to STDERR.
